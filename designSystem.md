# Design System

- Good Website: https://www.designsystems.com/

## What do I need

- naming conventions for all sketch things
- colors
  - names need meaning (e.g. don't have "blue", have "primary". don't have "red", have "error")
  - gradients? probs don't need them
- typography
  - make a font? use a free font?
- 8 point grid system?
- components
  - list all of them before creating symbols
  - atomic components (single things like button)
  - molecules and organisms (combining atoms)
- how to do version control?

## Colors

- I like this article: https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/color-in-design-systems-a1c80f65fa3

- Choose brand colors quick
- don't use medium white/black colors. stay more to one side.
- choose a "digital" blue (e.g. for links)
- make a stack of colors (like home depot)
- Scale color names between 0 and 100 based on HSLâ€™s lightness, such as $color-gray-05 and $color-gray-92
- don't offer too much variety of variations of a color
- meaningful colors (success, warning, error, info)
- accessibility (WCAG 2.0) (https://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com/)
- Solve the Reverse Light on Dark and Dark on Light

- Contrast Tools
