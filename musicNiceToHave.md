## Desktop Player Mode (just fullscreen player)

Good lookin view with the sole purpose of displaying what is currently playing.
- Allow user to customize the desktop player mode? Could kinda give them some components and let them mess around with it

## Integrate with multiple platforms

Don't just do spotify. Could do youtube or your own personal music library.

Have a leaf have multiple leaves? Like, a song is always a leaf. But maybe I want the recorded verison of the song and a live version of the song to be connected as the same song.

## Commands

Give the user the ability to create commands to play music. For example,

- Play a random album
- Play a random album from BTS
- Play the album from BTS that I listend to the longest ago.
- Play all songs from BTS, shuffled

This kinda goes against the whole "only allowed to play jam session". Unless the commands somehow are a jam session????

## Current Action

A current action allows you to define what you are currently trying to do and easily apply it to things. Some examples are
  - **Add to Jam Session X**: I'm currently creating a new jam session named "X". I'd like to look through my library of songs and have a shortcut button to add a song or label to the jam session. (TODO: should this just be a completely different view?)
  - **Exclude from Jam Session**
  - **Make song/label descendant of label X**: I created a new label "K-pop" and would like to go through my existing artist labels and set all the k-pop artists to be a descendant of the K-pop label.
  - **Fully Remove from Tree**: My tree of songs has gotten out of hand and I want to remove stuff.

## Misc.

- Give Images to labels. Allow for rotating images (like I upload 2 and it changes between the 2 every day)?
- Spotify does a good job keeping a history of the pages you've visited and going backwards.
- If I create a "BTS" label I want it to kinda stay in sync with spotify's BTS artist data, and same with albumsÂ (and I guess songs?). Or at least notify when changes occur whether they would like to update.
- Keep a history of all tree additions/changes/deletions.
- Conversion from existing spotify playlist to tree?
- Choose from a few different main colors?
