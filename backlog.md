## Project Features/Domains Ideas

- schedule
  - plan out what i'm supposed to do
  - phone notifications
  - one or the other? so, say i want to reserve time for the queue. if there's nothing on the queue then maybe i can have a secondary option to do
  - if i do the schedule first then i can integrate all other features into it
- health
  - weight
  - food calories/nutrients
  - exercise
- closet
  - pictures of clothes
  - clothes i want
  - links to where i bought clothes
- queue
  - basically a todo list
  - if i have a schedule then one of the timeslots could be reserved for queue
